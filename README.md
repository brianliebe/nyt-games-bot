# NYT Games Discord Bot ðŸ¤–

### A little Discord bot that tracks Wordle, Connections, and Strands scores and maintains a server leaderboard.

Track the daily, weekly, and all-time leaderboards for your server, plus get some additional stats on how well you've played. Just copy & paste your game results into Discord chat and the bot will track it.
