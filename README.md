# Wordle Discord Bot ðŸ¤–

### A little Discord bot that tracks users' Wordle scores and maintains a leaderboard.

Track the daily, weekly, and all-time leaderboards for your server, plus get some additional stats on how well you've played. Just copy & paste your Wordle results into Discord chat and the bot will track it.

### ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ¨ â¬œ

## Commands
- `?ranks (today|week|all-time|<puzzle #>)`
  - Bot will reply with the ranked leaderboard based on the query time period/puzzle #. Defaults to week.
- `?missing (today|<puzzle #>)`
  - Bot will reply and @mention users that are missing the puzzle. Defaults to today.
- `?entries [<user>]`
  - Bot will reply with the recorded entries in the database for \<user\>. Defaults to requester.
- `?stats [<user1> <user2> ...]`
  - Bot will reply with data on the user's average scores, etc. Defaults to requester. (More data coming soon maybe...)
- `?add [<user>] <puzzle output>`
  - Bot will record the Wordle puzzle entry for a user. Defaults to requester.
  - NOTE: `?add` is NOT needed to record entries. Just paste the output from Wordle right into the the channel and the bot will record it. The bot will react to your message with a âœ… to let you know it has been counted.

## Example Usage

1. Adding a score normally (without `?add`):

2. Viewing the leaderboard with `?ranks`:

## Notes

This project is not complete and you might need some tweaking to get this up-and-running on a new server. I am currently using a MySQL database to store the entries, but anything would work given enough effort. The database has two tables: `users` (columns `user_id` and `name`) and `entries` (columns `puzzle_id`, `user_id`, `score`, `green`, `yellow`, `other`).

To deploy this yourself, I highly suggest taking a look at [this](https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/) guide.

## TODO

- Add permissioning so that only specific channels may be used
- ~Add permissioning so that only specific users may enter scores (and/or only some users may use `?add`)~ Done âœ…
- ~Add a better database implementation~ Done âœ…
